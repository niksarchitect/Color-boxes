# Color-boxes
Here is a game i made with Javascript/Css/and HTML
I am working on this project to make myself understand the relation between HTML and Javascript. 
I have a lot of experience working with algorythem but when it comes to use them in my HTMl I have hard time.
Please add to this game if you have more ideas. 
Thanks.
